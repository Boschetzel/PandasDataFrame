## About

A Python application which allows users to open a csv file
 , **visualize**, **manipulate** and **plot  data** according to their needs using **"Pandas"**.

I used Pyqt5 to create a GUI for this project **after** the back-end code was written, 
**which was a mistake** from my part, I learned this the "hard way".

Keep in mind that the  GUI **is not design to look good.**
My goal was to put in practice the new things I learned, by coding.

Project is also **published on Pypi** under the name of : PandasDataFrame

NB: **the ML part  is not yet finished** as **I still am on a learning path with Python**.
Quick note: weather info option works only for Romania cities.

```

PandasDataFrame comes with **2 sample datasets** :
- Covid DataSet
- FIFA Dataset

  - Rename Column, 
  - Delete Column
-DataFrame a**nalysis**:
