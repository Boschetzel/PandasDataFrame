## About

PandasDataFrame is a simple Python project for viewing,
analyzing  and  plotting Pandas DataFrames.

Final project will make possible getting data
from a web API, csv file or web scrapping.

I used Pyqt5 to create a GUI for this project with some basic functionalities.
This GUI is not design to look good, just to make the project functional,as
my intention with this project was to learn to code not to design GUI.

Working on: cleaning and documenting the code
Note: the ML part is not yet finished as I still am on a learning path with Python, when I am ready I will commit it.

Project is also published on Pypi under the name of : PandasDataFrame
